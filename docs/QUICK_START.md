# 🚀 Quick Start - File Reorganization

## ✅ What I've Done For You

I've created the following:

1. **`MIGRATE_FILES.php`** - Automated script to move and update all files
2. **`includes/config.php`** - Moved database config
3. **`includes/profile_menu_popup.php`** - Moved profile menu
4. **Updated `index.php`** - Updated paths to work with new structure
5. **Complete documentation** - See `FILE_STRUCTURE.md` and `REORGANIZE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## 🎯 Two Ways to Reorganize

### **Option 1: Automated (RECOMMENDED) - Use the Migration Script**

#### Step 1: Backup Your Files
```
Make a copy of your webprogsystem folder!
```

#### Step 2: Run the Migration Script
Visit: `http://localhost/webprogsystem/MIGRATE_FILES.php`

This will:
- ✅ Create all necessary folders
- ✅ Move all files to new locations
- ✅ Update all file paths automatically
- ✅ Keep original files (for safety)

#### Step 3: Test Everything
- Visit `http://localhost/webprogsystem/`
- Try logging in
- Check student/admin pages
- Verify CSS and JS load properly

#### Step 4: Clean Up (After Testing)
If everything works:
- Manually delete the old files (they're still in root)
- Delete `MIGRATE_FILES.php`

### **Option 2: Manual - Follow Instructions**

If you prefer manual control:
1. Read `REORGANIZE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Move files one category at a time
3. Test after each category

## 📂 New Structure After Migration

```
webprogsystem/
├── index.php                    # ✅ Already updated
│
├── includes/                    # ✅ Created
│   ├── config.php              # ✅ Moved & updated
│   └── profile_menu_popup.php  # ✅ Moved & updated
│
├── pages/                       # 📦 Will be created by script

```

## ⚡ Quick Command (Automated)

Just visit this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost/webprogsystem/MIGRATE_FILES.php
```

The script will:
1. Create all folders
2. Copy files with updated paths
3. Show you a report of what was moved
4. Keep originals safe

---

## 🔍 What Gets Updated Automatically

The migration script updates:

- ✅ `require_once 'config.php'` → `require_once '../../includes/config.php'`
- ✅ `include 'profile_menu_popup.php'` → `include '../../includes/profile_menu_popup.php'`
- ✅ `href="style.css"` → `href="../../assets/css/style.css"`
- ✅ `src="script.js"` → `src="../../assets/js/script.js"`
- ✅ `Location: index.php` → `Location: ../../index.php`
- ✅ `Location: student_page.php` → `Location: ../student/dashboard.php"`
- ✅ And many more!

## 🎯 After Migration - Access Points

| Page | New URL |
|------|---------|
| Login | `http://localhost/webprogsystem/` |
| Student Dashboard | `http://localhost/webprogsystem/pages/student/dashboard.php` |
| Admin Dashboard | `http://localhost/webprogsystem/pages/admin/dashboard.php` |
| View Events | `http://localhost/webprogsystem/pages/shared/view_events.php` |

But you still access via login first!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backup First** - Always backup before running scripts
2. **Test Thoroughly** - Check all pages after migration
3. **Old Files Stay** - Original files won't be deleted automatically
4. **Browser Console** - Press F12 to check for 404 errors (missing files)
5. **Database Unchanged** - No database changes, just file organization

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Restore from backup** - That's why we made one!
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for missing files
3. **Check `includes/config.php`** - Make sure database credentials are correct
4. **Read error messages** - They'll tell you what's missing

## 📚 Additional Documentation

- **`FILE_STRUCTURE.md`** - Complete structure overview
- **`REORGANIZE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Detailed manual instructions
- **`create_structure.bat`** - Creates folders only (Windows)

---

## ✨ Benefits After Reorganization

- 📁 **Clear Structure** - Know where everything is
- 🔍 **Easy to Find** - Logical grouping by function
- 📈 **Scalable** - Easy to add new features
- 👥 **Team-Friendly** - Other developers understand it
- 🛠️ **Maintainable** - Fix bugs faster
