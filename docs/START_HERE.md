## ❓ Troubleshooting

### If CSS/JS doesn't load:
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look for 404 errors
3. Verify paths in the HTML source

### If you get "File not found":
1. Make sure you're accessing `http://localhost/webprogsystem/` (not the old file names)
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check the new file locations in the structure above

### If redirects don't work:
1. The paths have been auto-updated
2. Try logging in again
3. Check if you're using the correct URL

## 🗑️ Cleaning Up Old Files

### After Testing (Optional):

Once you've confirmed everything works, you can delete the old files in the root directory:

**Old files you can delete:**
- All old `.php` files in root (except `index.php`, `config.php`, `profile_menu_popup.php`)
- All old `.css` files in root
- All old `.js` files in root
- Old images in `assets/` root (keep `assets/images/`)

**PowerShell command to clean up:**
```powershell
# BE CAREFUL - Only run this after testing!
# Navigate to webprogsystem directory first

Remove-Item student_page.php, admin_page.php, MyProfilePage.php, 
          student_calendar.php, admin_calendar.php, attendance.php,
          view_events.php, view_ticket.php, 
          edit_event_page.php, delete_event_page.php,
          login_register.php, forgot_password.php, 
          verify_code.php, reset_password.php,
          add_event.php, edit_event.php, delete_event.php,
          get_events.php, register_event.php,
          get_registered_events.php, get_registration_info.php,
          verify_ticket.php, mark_attendance.php,
          update_university_calendar.php,
          verify_code_handler.php, reset_passwordhandler.php,
