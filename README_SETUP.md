# National University Events Calendar - Setup Instructions

## Database Setup (XAMPP)

### Step 1: Create Events Table
1. Open **phpMyAdmin** in your XAMPP
2. Select your database `student_db`
3. Go to the **SQL** tab
4. Copy and paste the contents from `database_setup.sql`
5. Click **Go** to execute

The table structure includes:
- `id` - Auto-increment primary key
- `title` - Event title
- `description` - Event description
- `event_type` - Type (Events, Webinar, Seminars, Workshop)
- `start_date` - Event start date and time
- `end_date` - Event end date and time
- `location` - Event location
- `created_by` - User ID of creator (foreign key to student table)
- `created_at` - Timestamp of creation

### 2. **Student Page** (`student_page.php`)

```

## Testing

1. **Login as Admin** to access calendar and event management
2. **Login as Student** to view events only
3. **Create Event**: Use the CREATE button or "+ add events" link
4. **Edit Event**: Click on any event in the upcoming events list

## Notes

- The database connection uses your existing `config.php` with XAMPP MySQL settings
- Events are displayed in chronological order (soonest first)
- All event operations require admin authentication
- The marquee banner scrolls continuously across the top of the page
